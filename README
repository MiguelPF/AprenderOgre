AprenderOgre (Dec 24th 2011)
------------------------------

AprenderOgre is an example of combining OpenNI with the Ogre3D Render Engine.
Is similar to the AppSinbad example but easier. It works on Windows.


OpenNI: 
https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI

Ogre3D:
http://www.ogre3d.org/

AppSinbad:
https://github.com/OpenNI/SampleAppSinbad

I use Visual Studio 2008 and follow the advices from the Ogre Wiki to create an Ogre project.
http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/Setting+Up+An+Application+-+Visual+Studio
The code is divided in 3 classes:
Kinect class Holds the kinect information in a structured manner.
Base Application is the Base Class for the Ogre part and is very general it can be useful 
for any Ogre project.
Tutorial Application is the specific class for this example.

Use Controls:
V Activates/Desactivates the Kinect.
K Show/Hide Kinect information panel (Num Users, Tracking)
ESC Exit
G General Information
